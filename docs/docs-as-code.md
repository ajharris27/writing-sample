# Technical writers as part of a docs-as-code workflow

Docs-as-code is a popular approach in many software companies for creating and maintaining documentation. With this method, technical writers are more integrated into the development process with software developers, and they share the same tools and workflows. This article shows the impact the docs-as-code workflow can have on technical writers and what the keys are for technical writers to succeed in a docs-as-code workflow. 

## What is a docs-as-code workflow?
A docs-as-code workflow generally has the following characteristics: 

- **Version control:** Documentation is stored in a Git repository, where contributions to the documentation are tracked and managed through pull/merge requests. This makes it easy to see what changes were made to the documentation over time.
- **Plain text formatting:** Documentation is written in an easy to use markup language, such as Markdown. Formatting a document is simple, and documentation is edited in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.
- **Increased collaboration:** The first draft of documentation is usually started by developers and is reviewed by technical writers in GitHub. This makes it easy for multiple developers and technical writers to collaborate and give feedback on the documentation. 
- **Automated testing:** Documentation goes through a review process that can include automatic tests for basic style and grammar errors to ensure consistency and maintain quality.

## What are the challenges for technical writers?

While the docs-as-code workflow can lead to increased collaboration, improved consistency, and more transparency, there are also some challenges for technical writers.

### Learning developer tools

A docs-as-code workflow requires technical writers to learn and become comfortable with at least the fundamentals of Git and GitHub. The basic commands do not take too much time to learn and use, but Git can become complicated when things go wrong, such as when there are conflicts between the local and remote repositories. Technical writers might need to become comfortable using more complex features of Git or have developers on the team who are willing to support if necessary. 

In addition to Git, technical writers in a docs-as-code workflow might also need to familiarize themselves with using a static site generator, understanding a CI/CD pipeline, and using the command line. 

### Markdown’s limitations

Markdown is a simple language, which is both a strength and a weakness. The simplicity of Markdown is an asset when creating and editing most software documentation, but it does have some limitations when it comes to formatting. Complex or longer docs might need to be created in a format other than Markdown.

### Rapidly changing documentation

It can be challenging for technical writers to review and edit large, complex pages if they are simultaneously being updated by developers. Also, documentation in a fast-paced software company can quickly become outdated. This means technical writers need to be proactive in maintaining the documentation and make sure they are regularly tracking any updates to the documentation.

## What do technical writers need to succeed in a docs-as-code workflow?

### Clear workflows

Clearly defined workflows and naming conventions related to editing documentation in a team’s repository should be easily accessible for technical writers. This information should be well-documented and easy for technical writers to find, especially if different product teams in the same organization follow slightly different workflows.

### Maintaining consistency

In a docs-as-code environment, documentation is often spread over multiple different repositories for different product teams. Maintaining consistent style and formatting between different teams’ documentation can be difficult unless there is a style guide or templates to follow. 

### Open communication

Technical writers should feel comfortable asking questions, making comments, and leaving feedback when reviewing documentation. The line of communication between technical writers, developers, and product managers should be always open to make sure there is an environment that encourages collaboration.

## Conclusion

The docs-as-code approach has many advantages, but it can be difficult for technical writers to follow. Implementing a few strategies to address these challenges can help organizations create a more effective docs-as-code workflow. This can benefit technical writers, developers, and the overall documentation process.
